A simple Java project for presenting the costs of specific activities and their laborers participating to them.

Each activity's cost is calculated by summing its three laborers' costs which we can change dynamically. 
For presenting the above instances and current values, we create a jtable showing the activities,
and by clicking to one of them, a new jtable, showing its particular laborers,is created. In the former table,
we can change the cost values, and by doing so, the related activity cost is recalculated and shown in the activity table.
All values are stored in a database(mysql). Hibernate is used for object communication with database.

Key concepts: Java, Java Swing, JFrame, JTable, Maven, Hibernate
